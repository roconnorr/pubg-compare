# pubg-compare
React web app for comparing the statistics of multiple pubg players using https://pubgtracker.com/site-api 
 
View a Live Version of the site at: http://www.pubg-com.me/

# Info
Work in progress. Start redis and then run server.js for the api wrapper. See inside pubg-compare-frontend for info on 
running the React app.

If the live site is returning player not found for any player, check the status of the api at 
pubgtracker.com. It might currently be disabled.

Current Status:

"Api is disabled due to throttling we are getting from Bluehole.  Please do not contact us, we will re-enable the API as soon as it's possible. We're sorry for any trouble this has caused, but it's outside of our control."
