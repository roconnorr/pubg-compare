pubg stats - start with react frontend app that compares the stats of multiple pubg players given pubg name or steam id

backend
	nodejs + express
	REST wrapper for pubg api
	uses pubg api wrapper that caches in redis
	possibly used in future to store stuff in a db
	any other backend requirements

	endpoints:
		/api/playername/:player_name
		/api//steamid/:steam_id

		api and client need more error handling
			player not found - done
			empty search - not done


frontend
	react
	react charts lib tbd
	features:
		compare x players stats
			numbers and graphz
		cool ui with pics

	lowest player component field = red, highest = green

	components
		app
			playerlist - contains player objects
				players - Takes json of players and compare stats
					searchbox - search box and button

			graphs
